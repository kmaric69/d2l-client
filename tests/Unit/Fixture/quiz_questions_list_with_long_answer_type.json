                "Text": "Sample Essay A: This essay is scored a 6, the highest grade.\nMy mother always says, “Blood is thicker than water.” She means that no matter how busy she and my father are, how much the demands of life press down on them, they will be there for us. They expect their children to all stick together, too. It sounds like a cliché, but it is true: you can be penniless, but if you are fortunate enough to have a loving family, you are wealthy indeed.\nOne thing is sure: my family never had a lot of money. Growing up in a large Irish Catholic family meant that we had to make sacrifices. My family consists of my father Brian (a police officer), my mother Colleen (a part-time nurse), my five siblings, my maternal grandmother Rose, my aunt Danielle, and my little cousin Tyler. We learned to be thrifty early on. For example, when we get home from school, we change from our school clothes to our play clothes so we can pass down those nice sweaters and jeans in good condition to our younger siblings. In the winter, we eat a lot of soups, stews, and spaghetti because they are cheap; in the summer, we eat a lot of mackerel and quahogs because we live by the Atlantic Ocean and can fish and clam for free. My parents rarely have much free time because they are always working, cooking, or cleaning, but they make time for all of us nonetheless. When I was in 4th and 5th grade, I had trouble with math. My family didn’t have the money to hire a tutor to help me, so they helped me themselves. Some nights after dinner, my mother would help me with my homework and give me a mini-quiz. She always said, “You’re smart, Tara, and you’ll learn this math. I believe in you.” When she was too busy, one of my sisters or brothers would help me. By the time I was in 6th grade, I was a math whiz. We didn’t have much money, but my family gave me something more precious: their time, support, and belief in me.\nWe make sacrifices for each other and stick together, too. When my grandmother Rose broke her hip last summer, everyone took a turn taking care of her. My brother Shawn gave up his after-school job at the grocery store to help out. My aunt Danielle took over the laundry so my mother could nurse Grandma Rose. No one complained about the extra work because family is there for each other.\nI don’t have the latest designer handbag or a new cell phone. My family has never jetted off to Europe on a skiing trip. We can’t replace the sofa that the dog chewed. Nonetheless, I am one of the wealthiest people I know because I have my family. Money comes and goes, but my family is there for me forever.\nSample Essay A Explanation:\nThis essay is outstanding because the writer directly addresses the prompt and successfully convinces the audience that she is indeed “rich” because she has a loving and supportive family. The first paragraph grabs the reader’s attention with an appropriate quote, followed by a direct statement of the thesis: “It sounds like a cliché, but it is true: you can be penniless, but if you are fortunate enough to have a loving family, you are wealthy indeed.” Notice the sophisticated sentence construction: the colon is used to connect two independent clauses in which the second clause gives a specific example to illustrate the first clause. The writer’s use of antonyms and synonyms of “rich”—“penniless” and “wealthy”—make the writing style more interesting. This paragraph sets the stage for the specific details that follow.\nFor example, in the second paragraph, the writer identifies the people in her family by name and includes their occupations, where relevant. She also gives an example of the family’s thrift: handing down “those nice sweaters and jeans in good condition to our younger siblings.” The last paragraph has vivid details as well: “I don’t have the latest designer handbag or a new cell phone. My family has never jetted off to Europe on a skiing trip. We can’t replace the sofa that the dog chewed.” Further, the writer uses poetic techniques, notably alliteration, to make her sentences smooth and flowing. This is evident in the phrase “soups, stews, and spaghetti.” The conclusion sums up the main ideas and makes the writer’s point. Notice how she ends on an emotional note to touch the reader’s heart.\nSample Essay B: This essay is scored a 1, the lowest grade.\nThe meaning of family differs in every culture around the world, although they all have the same general meaning a group of people related by blood who live together and loved each other. In my opinion, I believe a family is an integral part of a persons life and without a family no one can truley be happy.\nI come from a very large extended family they show me a lot of love and they always make me feel good about whatever I am doing. Without my family, I can say I would not have goten so far. They provide me with a sense of stability and help strengthen my moral believes. Whenever I feel down, they always know how to cheer me up and encourage me to keep trying these are all aspects that I feel that familys have.\nWhen you look at all the famous and well-known celebrities, influencers, and billionaires on TV and social media. At first look you think they are happy because they have everything they would ever want in the world all the houses and cars and fancy cloths and cell phones and technology. Somewhere along the line some of them stray from their families and live lonely lives these are the celebrities you often hear about in the news that end up ruining their lives over stupid mistakes. If they hadn’t strayed from their families. They most likely would not have gone through the situation they are going through right now that changed their lives. There familys would have helped them mentor them in a way that there false friends can not.\nThe definition of a family ultimatly depends on each person. A person does not have to be blood-related. There are children who never meet their real parents and grew up with a foster family. To them, their foster families are their real families there the only families they know. Their familys are just as loving and careing as those of blood families. A family is the best medicine that can cure all sickness and illness, I know that people are more likely to become really rich and have a lot of money if they have a good family. I know this is true. I would never give up my family, if I had to chose between my family and being really rich, I would allways pick my family.\nSample Essay B Explanation\nThis essay is in trouble from the very start, because few would agree with the writer’s definition of “family.” Most people, in contrast, would argue that the members of a family do not have to be related by blood, as step-parents and adopted children are clearly members of a family. Further, people do not have to live together to be considered part of a family. Were this the case, college students who dorm for the school year and perhaps travel in the summer would no longer be considered part of their families. Finally, people without families may indeed be happier—perhaps happier than some people who do have families.\nThe second paragraph lacks sufficient details to show how having a family makes the writer feel rich. This paragraph also contains information about celebrities that has nothing to do with the topic.\nThe third paragraph contradicts the first one, as the writer had earlier posited that a blood relationship is necessary for people to be considered part of the same family. This paragraph also shows a deep misunderstanding of the topic. The writer argues that having a good family can help you become economically successful. The prompt, in contrast, posits that having a family makes you emotionally rich because of the love and support they give you, regardless of economic status.\nFinally, the paper is rife with errors in sentence boundaries and spelling that interfere with meaning.",
